- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain

- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria

## Notes

- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit-clarify` or `/speckit-plan`
- [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] marker is present in FR-010 regarding whether the backend should validate Supabase-issued JWTs directly using JWKS, or implement its own local JWT authentication mechanism.
